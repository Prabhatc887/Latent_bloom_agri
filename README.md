## Problem Statement

Farmers often lack **clear, timely, and growth-stage–specific guidance** for effective crop management. Existing agricultural solutions suffer from:

- **Generic Recommendations** – Advice does not adapt to crop growth stages or conditions  
- **Text-Heavy Resources** – Difficult to understand for farmers with varying literacy levels  
- **Limited Accessibility** – Critical information is hard to access, especially in rural areas  

These gaps lead to **inefficient practices, reduced yields, and wasted resources**.

## Our Solution — Latent_Bloom

**Latent_Bloom** is an **AI-powered, visual-first agricultural guidance system**.

Starting from a **single crop image**, the system:

- Generates **5–6 crop lifecycle stages**
- Creates a **smooth growth transition video**
- Produces **stage-wise images**
- Provides **synchronized audio guidance** for each stage

The focus is on making advanced agricultural insights **simple, visual, and actionable**.
